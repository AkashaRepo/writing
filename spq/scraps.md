You are Princess Lydia Tanhäuser Von Cygnus Gates the third, Second child of King Isaac Sigfried Von Gates the first and Queen Lydia Brunhilde Von Cygnus the second, and second in line to the throne of Midland.
Your earliest memory is the sound of your kingdom shaken by war.

She had started her research with the intent to create a boundless energy source for peaceful purposes, only to find it used as the ultimate weapon in a war to end all wars.
