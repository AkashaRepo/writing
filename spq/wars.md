Notable conflicts in the world of SPQ
=====================================

This is a brief list of historical conflicts which directly shape the events of Space Princess Quest.

The Great War
=============
Starting 17 years before the events in SPQ, and terminating with the destruction of the Nordic capital by radio reactive weapons, the Great war is the single deadliest conflict in the history of Midland

Cause
-----
The Great war began with the rise of the Kriegfuer who unified all of the Nordic tribes under his banner with the goal of realizing what he considered the Nordic people's destiny as a space-faring race. Unfortunately limited resources and a high latitude prevented the development of the necessary technologies without first building a sizable terrestrial empire.

Conflict
--------
In order to secure these assets, the Nordic fleets advanced southwards and annexed the eastern isles. This in turn caused conflict with the Kingdom of midland which claimed, but did not exercise, dominion over the western islands due to ancient treaties. The war at sea intensified as both nations committed their powerful navies. In order to break this stalemate, the Nords to began a strategic bombing campaign over midland, bypassing the Royal Navy and striking at the homeland. At the time, Midland's doctrine for air war was based on the concept of the Sky knight. Each noble house contributing a single ace pilot with a custom fighter plane. The ability of a single pilot had been proven in previous wars, and was considered best practice by most of Midland's military theorists. The Nordic air forces on the other hand, made use of mass produced aircraft with uniformly trained pilots. As a result, heavily escorted Nordic flying fortresses were able to easily penetrate Midland's air defenses and caused massive devastation. With midland's defenses in ruins from the strategic bombing campaign, the Kriegfeur pushed for an invasion and occupation of Midland's mainland. Amphibious units made landfall and advanced rapidly across the countryside in a combined arms Blitzkrieg attack. This advance was halted just 3 day's march from Midland's capital in the battle of Fallowfield. A midland military research devision had been developing a secret weapon in a hidden laboratory in an abandoned farm. The radio-reaction device was the codename for a weapon which would use arcane radio-alchemical processes to split elemental nuclei and unleash the immense energies contained within. When the invasion started, it was planned to evacuate the facility, but the prototype was too heavy to move quickly.Eventually the decision was made to detonate it as soon as the invasion force overran it's location. The bomb worked and in a single instant, nearly half the Nordic ground forces were annihilated, with the remainder driven back to the sea by Midland's counter-attack. This was the turning point, and a few months latter, a second bomb was launched by a long range rocket to remove the Nordic capital from the map and unquestionably end the war.

Aftermath
---------
With the Nordic capital reduced to a steaming crater, Midland sued for peace with the fragmentary remains of the Nordic tribes. Under the new treaties, the tribes had to remain separate, and were forbidden from developing either rocketry or radio-alchemy. The Nordic fleet was destroyed by a test of a third radio reactive weapon which served as a prototype for an arsenal of 10 weapons which would serve as a deterrent in the future. In addition, midland's armed forces were re-enforced with the addition of the Royal Rocket Corps and Royal Air force as standing armies. Previously midland's armies were property of the individual landed lords, and only raised in times of war. The only permanent armed forces were the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. The RAF on the other hand were formed during the war, under the king's orders, and were assumed to be temporary stations for the duration of the war. However, under the command of General Clay, the Royal Air force has yet to disband. The Royal rocket corps occupies a similar position, but is controlled directly by the crown via it's new director, Princess Lydia Tannhauser Von Cygnus Gates the Third.

Colonial Wars/War of independence
=================================
Although it took place nearly a hundred years before The great war, the Colonial Wars foreshadowed the great war with their industrialization and scope. Unfortunately the true lessons of the colonial war went largely un-learned and the same mistakes were repeated once more.

Cause
-----
In the period before the colonial wars, Midland had been relatively prosperous and was benefiting from an influx of new ideas due to it's colonial holdings. These new ideas, and generally permissive social attitudes, led to a period of social progress and alchemical development called The Precipitate. Among these new ideas brought about by the Precipitate was the movement for independence in Midland's southern colonies. As peaceful were violently suppressed by merchant houses owned by midland's aristocracy. Forced with the prospect of fighting their own people, a group of Suthish soldiers who were under the employ of the merchant houses revolted and joined the side of the people in armed resistance. While the members of the aristocracy which owned the merchant houses were quick to dismiss the resistance as an unlawful mutiny, a number of the emerging middle classes sided with the rebels. More importantly, a number of merchant houses which were not doing business in the south saw this as an opportunity to weaken their competitors back home. Thus the rebels received weapons and training from the same nation they were fighting against.
