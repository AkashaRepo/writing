Sky Knight Quest
================

>1500meters above the Nordic sea.
>0800 hours.
You are Sir Charles Harker, count of Halcyon and Sky knight of the kingdom of Midland. You are currently flying your trademark red comet special on an anti-submarine patrol. There is a war going on, or so you've been told, and the Royal Navy is engaged somewhere in the eastern isles. Because of this the feudal levies have been called up to defend the homeland in it's place, and that's the reason you are up here freezing your glorious arse off flying up and down the coast looking for U-boats.

Fortunately you aren't alone up here. In the Co pilot's seat behind you is Parker, your copilot and squire, and flying a few hundred meters ahead of you is the Duke of Firthing's flying fortress. Also present is the count of Zypher, flying in formation below the flying fortress as it preforms a mid air refueling. A few more hours and you get to go home.

What do?
>Get in line behind Zypher and get ready to refuel.
>scan the horizon, You are technically at war here.
>Fly closer for a good look at Zypher's machine.
>Make small talk with Parker to pass the time, you aren't in any hurry.
>Double check all your instruments, the comet needs special care.
>Write in.
Decisions will be made by popular vote, with GM reserving tiebreaker and veto privlages.
