SPQ Timeline
============

Billions of years ago (Old Earth)
> * first organic life evolves on old Earth.

Millions of years ago (Old Earth)
> * Human civilization evolves on old Earth.
> * Human civilization launches slower-than-light seed spacecraft to colonize galaxy.
> * Human civilization on earth collapses.

Hundreds of thousands of years ago (Old earth)
> * First interstellar spacecraft begin to reach their destinations thousands of years latter.
> * All human life on earth goes extinct.

Approximately ten thousand years ago (Gaia)
> * A seed ship arrives in distant solar system and begins to Terraform the second planet, which will latter be named Gaia.
> * The earliest signs of life appear in Gaia's fossil record. A layer of bioengineered peat moss set up to build a habitable atmosphere, serve as a foundation for a larger biosphere, and as an emergency reserve of fossil fuels for future colonists.
> * The seed ship establishes human colony on the newly terraformed planet and begins to develop the system, constructing  an archive on the dark side of the planet's moon and a starship factory in the outer solar system.
> * The seed ship and starship factory are destroyed in an act of terrorism by one of the human colonists. The archive's AI goes insane (possibly the victim of an electronic warfare attack) and kills all of it's human crew before going into hibernation. The only remaining humans in the system are stranded on Gaia with no way to access space.

Thousands of years ago (Gaia)
> * The surviving colonists struggle to adopt an agricultural base on a partly teraformed planet without industrialization. Harsh conditions lead to a utilitarian and autocratic hydraulic Empire centered on the western coast of Gaia's central continent. Knowledge is guarded fiercely by an administrating caste which forms the basis for all future aristocracy.
> * Factions develop within the empire. Intellectual tradition fractures into Astrology (Knowledge as a way to decide proper courses of action) and Alchemy (knowledge of the world as a way to shape it) Both traditions remain at odds for thousands of years.
> * First empire spreads across the central continent, into the southern and northern continents, and onto the eastern islands.
> * Collapse of first empire into waring kingdoms and city states due to excessive administrative overhead.
> * The Dark ages begin, Knowledge of Humanity's interstellar history becomes mythologized. Alchemy is suppressed as witchcraft while Astrology becomes the dominant intellectual tradition in midland.

Hundreds of years ago (Elsewhere)	
> * The posthuman descendants of one of the scattered colonies discovers secrets of FTL travel.
> * Formation of the 'Union of Spacefairing Entities'. Or simply 'The Union' for short.
> * Union begins to slowly re-unite the scattered human colonies into it's hegemonic sphere, fostering interstellar trade.

Hundreds of years ago (Gaia)
> * King Gates the first liberates eastern plains of central continent from northern conquerers and founds kingdom of midland, begining the Gates Dynasty which rules for next 700+ years.
> * Kingdom of Midland conquers the city states on western coast which once formed the Old Empire's capital, as well as most of the sourthern continent.
> * Gates Dynasty claims the title of Emperor, beginning the second empire.

Many decades ago (Gaia)
> * Cultural reforms lead to a resurgence in alchemy which leads to a new era of industrialization.
> * Midland's colonial holdings in the south break away from the motherland to become independent nations, starting the colonial wars and abolishing the second empire.
> * The resulting wars are dominated by industrialization and new weapons which cause massive losses of life. This sours the concept of war but re-ignites age old conflict between Alchemy and Astrology.

Many decades ago (Elsewhere)
> * The Union encounters a hostile alien civilization.
> * Both civilizations come in conflict over expanding spheres of influence.
> * The resulting war rages across thousands of star systems resulting in billions of human, alien, and sentient machine casualties before ending inconclusively.
> * A union warship patrolling an outer flank of the combat zone encounters a previously uncontacted human civilization in a previously unexplored star system. Because the civilization has not developed spaceflight it is not a candidate for Union membership, however it remains a subject of observation because of it's relative proximity to the war.

The previous two decades (Gaia)
> * Light from the warship is spotted by astrologers and interpreted as a sign of a new era.
> * A political faction on the northern continent uses this sign as an excuse to seize power, creating the third empire and beginning the largest and bloodiest war in Gaian history.
> * Midland creates Royal Air Corps and Royal Rocket Corps to bolster their fighting forces and develop new weapons to win the war.
> * Heroines of Space Princess Quest born.
> * Midland ends the war with the invention of rocketry and radio-reactive (atomic) weapons.
> * The northern empire is dissolved and disarmed. It's fleet is destroyed in a nuclear test and midland acquires it's newfound colonial holdings in the eastern isles.
> * General Clay of the Royal Air Corps becomes de-facto ruler of eastern isles, disposing the local chiefs.

Now
> * Both wars are over.
> * Jakisan Kenaway, first daughter of the Merikan City state, founds the Southern Space Council for peaceful space exploration.
> * Lydia Tanhauser, princess of midland, joins Royal Rocketry Corps and re-directs it's mission to beat the southerners to the Moon.
> * Maia of Taurus, disposed princess of the eastern isles, volunteers to become a test pilot for the Royal Air Corps. Knowing full well that her people would revolt if any harm came to her, she hopes to inspire them to overcome their oppression.
> * Union warship 'Can You Hear Me Now?' visits Gaia and begins observation, considering the people of Gaia for Union membership.
