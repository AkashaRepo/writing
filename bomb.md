"If you don't mind my asking, why bother giving a bomb free will?" The weapons officer asked from her pod onboard the UGS iChoseNoise.
"I am an X-ray laser munitions package, thank you very much. The 'bomb' you speak of, is only one part of of a larger whole. The personality you are communicating with resides in the substraits of it's Targeting computer." 0xBA replied, it's synthetic voice modulated in a way that a human of Tara's cultural group would interpret as being mildly offended.
"I'm sorry..." Tara paused. 0xBA was capable of feeling such emotions, but right now was simply faking it for effect. This was slightly dishonest, but then again 0xBA WAS a weapon.
"...I mean like, that bomb powers your lasers when it goes of. Aren't you afraid to die?" Tara asked, her curiosity overcoming the embarrassment.
"It would depend on the person. I won't pretend I don't feel fear, but fear of ones own death is not part of my programming." 0xBA replied, adjusting it's voice to a more sincere intonation, having had it's fun at the human's expense.
"So afraid of something?" She asked hesitantly. once again curiosity getting the better of her.
"I fear many things. I fear what the Bugs might do to your planet, I fear the possibility of my weapons harming an innocent being by accident, or being subverted by an Electronic warfare attack. Most of all I fear my potential being wasted."
