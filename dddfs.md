The queen of heaven is the daughter of none and mother of all. She was created by Nobody, is the first of the immortal celestial maidens, and created the mortal universe.

As the thing created by nothing. The queen of heaven takes the form of a small child alone in an infinate void. Because she is lonely she plays with everything that exists and gives it form. Nobody gave her these things, and to nobody does she owe her power. Nobody existed before her, and nobody will exist when she is gone. She exists in everything that is something, and Nothing exists where she is not. Do you (not) understand this (un)truth?

As a celestial maiden, the queen of heaven is one of countless sisters. All were created by the thing from nothing, and all may claim to be the first. Each sister posesses everything, and none of them need to share.
