House rules and spacecraft for Diaspora.


* Artificial Intelligence.
As stated in the Diaspora rule-book, strong AI is only possible at T4 and one of the leading factors contributing to the inevitable collapse.
Stable AI is however, is a common troupe in many of the works of science fiction which inspired Diaspora. Presented here are a set of optional rules to address this discrepancy.

** Assumptions of progress.
Rather than the exponential growth of More's law, information technology in diaspora advances like all technology in a series of plateaus culminating in a T4 collapse.

*** T-1
The first computers are invented at this tech level, but lack the necessary complexity to maintain anything but the crudest approximations of intelligence. Nevertheless, interest in the possibility of artificial intelligence leads to an explosion in computing power at T0.

*** T0
At T0 computers and automation become widespread. During this period, computers become progressively more complex at a surprising rate. These computers are not yet truly sentient, but often capable of replacing humans in many tasks. Emergent AIs are sometimes created by accident, but these are often extremely alien in their thought process and difficult to control.

*** T1
At T1 this rapid progress in computer technology hits a plateau as microprocessors reach the theoretical limits of material technology. Progress still continues, but not at the same exponential rate as before. At this stage however, it is possible to perfectly simulate a human mind and produce a computer which can think like a human. The massive amount of computing power required however means such devices must be specially built into a facility with dedicated power and cooling systems.

*** T2
At T2 the algorithms required to simulate consciousness become more efficient and machine consciousness becomes more common. An electronic mind however still requires more energy to maintain than an organic one in many situations. Machines are more likely to be recognized as people deserving of rights as well. Most ships are sentient, but a human crew is considered important for maintaining it's mental health.

*** T3
At T3 the line between man and machine becomes indistinguishable. Machines are now made out of organic components, and humans are now augmented with synthetic components. The speed of light and laws of thermodynamics prevent a runaway explosion of intelligence, but it is now cost effective to make just about everything sentient unless cultural taboos prevent this. Some societies move large portions of their population into virtual space, or at least maintain an electronic afterlife for storing archived copies of the minds of deceased individuals.

*** T4
At T4 the limits of computation in the physical universe are overturned. It is now possible to store an infinite amount of thinking power in the fabric of the slipstream itself. Physical reality no longer holds any sort of interest to a society that can create any kind of reality in slip-space, and such societies soon quickly sever all ties to reality. From the perspective of everyone else they vanish forever.


** Sentient Spacecraft
Starting at T1, Sentient spacecraft become a possible choice for a player character.
