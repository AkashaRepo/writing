# Internship
From Tara's vantage point, high above the scattered disk of comets which circled the outer solar system, the light from the ISV's decelerating engines was the brightest star in the sky. More than 6 billion kilometers away, the sun was almost un-noticable if not pointed out specifically. It was just a slightly brighter than average star. The Interstellar Vehicle *"Higher than a skyscraper"*, by comparison was a mere 600 thousand kilometers away, and it's antimatter torch drive would have blinded her had she looked at it with her human eyes.

Fortunately, Tara's human eyes were closed. While her human body lay curled up in fetal position inside a suspension pod aboard the GS *"Formula of Fear"*, she observed her surroundings through the Gunship's military grade sensor array.
