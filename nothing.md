Before creation there was No god.

This non deity of non existence saw oblivion, and reveled in it's perfection for unknown aeons before the dawn of time. Nothing lasts forever, and in this state of nothingness, no god would have been content to sleep for all eternity, had it not been woken by the sudden intrusion of the old Gods of creation.

The Gods did not notice the nothingness, for nothing can escape their omniscient gaze. To them oblivion was nothing more than a great canvas on which to create, and create they did. They filled the sky with stars, surrounded each star with planets, and populated each planet with plants and animals. They also created the races of man to share in this creation, giving each of them the greatest gifts of all. To all of the sons and daughters of man, the gods gave the gifts of free will, self determination, and language. Then, once their great work was complete, the gods left this universe in order to allow their creations to create for themselves.

No god remained once they had left creation. It saw the works of the gods, and found them to be distasteful. Where had once been perfect oblivion, there was not flawed creation. No god hated creation, and most of all it hated mankind. Pathetic little animals, always building cities, falling in love, fucking each other and making more of themselves, fighting and dieing. Their miserable little lives were only a fraction as great as the gods that had created them, yet for some reason No god hatted them more than anything else.

The people of this age


When he entered the wandering lands, Nothing could defeat the conqueror.
                                     Nothing matters
				     Nothing is important
                   A brave man fears Nothing.
                    A kind man hates Nothing.
                A wise man overlooks Nothing.
                  A fool understands Nothing.
