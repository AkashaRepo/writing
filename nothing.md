To earth, The Queen of Heaven sent her only son, The Conqueror.
A perfect man, her greatest champion to bring order to creation.
Nothing escaped her sight.

He was without peer, all would fall to his sword or his beauty.


From each city, he selected the fairest daughter to be his queen and rule in his steed.
From each queen, he sired many children, but named no heirs or successors.
Nothing would satisfy him.
