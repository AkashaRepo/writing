Hundreds of years ago, man was the master of this blue earth. The people lived in great cities with towers of glass and steel which reached the skies. They mastered science and wielded the power of the atom. However, man became arrogant. They polluted the earth, and created weapons with the power of heaven itself. As man's arrogance grew they awoke the great guardian creatures of the earth, the Kaiju. Awoken from their slumber, the Kaiju cast their judgment on mankind and punished them for their wicked ways...

At least that's what the professor is telling you as you sit in class, bored as hell. Adults are always going on about the sins of the past and boring things like that. Anyways, your village is safe from Kaiju attacks because it has it's own guardian monster! You are the village's Sacrificial Maiden. The sacrifice part is mostly a figure of speech, it's been decades since any of you got eaten. Nowdays your job is to communicate with the guardian to keep it from attacking, and defend the island from other Kaiju.

It's such a nice day outside, but you have to sit in this boring schoolhouse listening to the professor drone on and on. Looking out the window at the pacific ocean you start to daydream... cont.

what is the guardian is doing right now.
Chose one,
>The guardian is a creature of the skies, right now it is soaring high above the island on it's mighty wings, capable of breaking the sound barrier.  
>The guardian is currently resting in the geothermal vents which power the island. It is capable of burrowing under the ground and bathing in liquid magma.  
>The guardian sleeps beneath the waves. When it wakes the waves crash and the earth shakes under it's feet.  

What is the guardian's power?
Chose one,
>The guardian's ultimate attack is a powerful energy beam capable of leveling entire cities.  
>The guardian is covered in tough armor. Harder than diamonds and tipped with razor sharp claws.  
>The guardian has power over the elements. (The exact nature of this power depends on the previous question)  

Once, the guardian was defeated in a battle with another Kaiju, what happened then?
Chose one,
>The guardian only looked like it was dead, but really it was only sleeping and healing it's wounds. Then it got right back up again and kicked ass!  
>The guardian's wounds were healed by scientists who built an armored exoskeleton for it! Now it's even stronger than before and armed with advanced weapons!  
>The old guardian died, but when all hope seemed lost, a new one was born from an egg to continue the fight!  

Lastly, what is the guardian's name?
>Free choice.

Your island's guardian monster is (Kaiju name) a (Kaiju description). The scientists say it's a category (3 or 4) but you aren't exactly sure what that means, just that it's the strongest one sighted in the pacific ocean in more than 50 years!

Class ends and not a moment too soon.
