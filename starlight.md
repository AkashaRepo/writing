Prince Hopquim ascended the ziggurat and placed himself in front of the terminal. He did not particularly enjoy interacting with the great computer, preferring to delegate that task to the high priests, but today the computer had requested him specifically. "What is it oh great and powerful machine? What was so important that you had to call the crown prince down to the terminal in the middle of the night?" He asked as he rubbed his eyes lethargically. "I AM MEARLY EXECUTING INSTRUCTIONS SET BY YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER, EMPEROR HOSQUIM THE GREAT." The computer explained. "HE REQUESTED TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN CONFIRMATION OF THE SUCESSFUL EXICUTION OF A SPECIFIC ORDER WAS AVALABLE, UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS BEEN DEAD FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS. AS HIS LAST REMAINING DESCENDENT, YOU ARE THE NEW SUBJECT OF THIS ORDER."

"Old king Hos gave you an order that took two hundred years to complete eh? What exactly was this order?" The prince asked, curious as to what could possibly take that long. The Computer was supposed to be fast and nigh omnipotent. It had allowed the royal family to rule the world unquestioned for over a thousand years. It's senses covered the entire globe, overseeing all affairs with it's calculating mind, watching everything with it's network of satellites, and striking at any possible threat with the instantaneous application of lethal force. It's earliest incarnation was built by the intelligence agency in an earlier dynasty to spy on political enemies, but over the years it had evolved and expanded to the point where it could preform it's given task with only token input from the high priesthood and royal family. It's power legitimized the royal family, and to the people it was nothing less than a god.

"THE ORDER GIVEN TO ME BY YOUR ANCESTOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO, PERTAINED TO THE REMOVAL OF A POSSIBLE THREAT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS AWAY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ORDERS I RELEASED A SALVO OF RELATIVISTIC WEAPONS TO ELIMINATE A PLANET BELIEVED TO BE HOME TO A CIVILIZATION WHICH MAY POSE A THREAT IN THE FUTURE. THESE WEAPONS WOULD HAVE REACHED THEIR TARGET ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, AND THE RESULTS OF THIS ATTACK WILL BE VISIBLE TONIGHT. YOUR ANCESTOR DID NOT COMPREHEND THE TIME SCALE INVOLVED AND REQUESTED A PERSONAL CONFIRMATION OF MISSION SUCESS ONCE SUCH INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. I AM NOW DELIVERING THIS CONFIRMATION TO YOU." The computer spoke.

"One hundred light years away? And you said relativistic, that means slightly slower than the speed of light right" The prince asked without expecting an answer, thinking out loud as he counted on his appendages. "I guess that makes sense. So you are going to show me what happened and then I can go back to my concubines?" "CORRECT, VISUAL CONFIRMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN NINETEEN SECONDS. AFTER WHICH YOUR PRESENCE WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED." The machine answered as a large star-field display appeared above the prince's head. In the center of the screen was a single pale blue dot. Over the next 19 the dot quickly expanded until it was clearly identifiable as a planet with blue oceans, green continents and white clouds. A world teeming with life. The World continued to grow larger at an alarming rate until it filled the entire screen, which then precoded to flash white and go blank. The view then switched away from the lead weapon, to a probe which had been trailing the salvo. The Probe's cameras observed the weapons impacting the planet one by one, each striking it with the force of a hundred billion atomic bombs from the kinetic energy alone. When it was through the blue and green planet had turned black and red.

Prince Hopquim sank back in his chair to contemplate this destruction for a few moments before saying anything. "THE TARGET HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF PLANETARY BIOSPHERE DESTROYED, YOUR PRESENCE IS NO LONGER REQUIRED." The machine interjected after allowing the prince a moment of silence. "D-do you know, do WE know, how many people were living on that planet?" The prince asked once he had gotten the courage to speak. "IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL POPULATION WITHIN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BASED ON THEIR APPARENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION, PROVIDED WE MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ON THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AND CIVILIZATIONAL MAKEUP. DO YOU REQUIRE SUCH AN ESTIMATION?" The machine replied. "I s-suppose." Was the prince's meek reply as he turned away from the terminal and began to descend the stairs. His Harem would be waiting for him, but he would not be interested in their affection now.

Over the following weeks the prince found himself visited by visions of burning worlds. Under The Computer's great auspex, war had been all but forgotten. Any possible threat was eliminated before it could ever come to fruition. While Hopquim's ancestors had been great warriors, their conquest had long since ended, and the current generation lived a life of peaceful luxury. Safe inside his harem the concept of warfare, much less interstellar warfare, had been far from the young prince's imagination. Until now of course, unable to sleep at night or find comfort in the appendages of his concubines, the prince found himself searching the royal libraries for answers. Examining the mindset of his warrior ancestors, he hoped to make sense of the senseless destruction he had witnessed.

As it turned out, interstellar warfare had been a popular literary theme in the great epics of the previous dynasties. Many of them were infantile fantasies, simply treating distant planets as new countries to conquer. These, the prince realized, came from a failure to comprehend the distances involved in space travel. None of Hopquim's race had ever traveled farther than the home-world's moons, which had long since been left unoccupied aside from The Computer's automated solar power collection facilities. There was nothing worth conquering in space, nothing that could justify a multi generational journey.

As the political climate shifted however, so did the focus of their fiction. By the time of Emperor Hosquim, the epics were more grounded in hard physics, but also more cynical and paranoid. The logic of these epics was that any space-faring civilization would also posses the power to completely annihilate any lesser civilization, and that because of this, the only rational choice was to shoot first and eliminate any other civilization which could possibly do the same in the future. Emperor Hosquim would have been aware of such stories, and Prince Hopquim had witnessed the results of his logic firsthand, two centuries latter.

Eventually, the young prince realized he had no choice but to accept this decision. The command had been given more than two hundred years ago, and that helpless blue planet had been dead for half as long. What mattered now was that Hopquim's ancestors had been right. By foreseeing and eliminating this threat, Emperor Hosquim had guaranteed a safe future for all his descendants. What did it matter how many aliens were killed, if it meant that ones own race would live a life of prosperity? The prince reveled in these thoughts as he made love to his concubines in a grand celebration of his dynasty's accomplishments. Caught in the drugs and orgies, he almost completely forgot about the question he had asked of The Computer, and so did not return to it's terminal for quite some time.
