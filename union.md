#Union of Spacefaring Entities

The Union of Spacefaring Entities (More commonly known as just 'The Union') is a loose coalition of organic and mechanical life forms capable of spaceflight. Combined they exercise a near total natural monopoly on interstellar travel thought the entirety of the visible universe.

The Union was formed as a set of mutually agreed upon codes of conduct between several independent cultures of self-replicating space probes, each created by different (now extinct) technological civilizations. Initially this was a simple agreement of mutual non-interference, but soon expanded to encompass mutual cooperation, resource sharing, and defense. Over thousands of years these agreements became a fully fledged alliance.

##Humanity

Humanity became the first terrestrial race to join the union, several thousand years after it's extinction. Earth had been rendered uninhabitable by climate change and nuclear war, but prior to the catastrophe an unmanned probe had been launched into interstellar space with a library of DNA samples and a complete record of human culture. This probe's machine intelligence was accepted into The Union and began to upgrade itself to be capable of self replication and planetary teraforming.

Human colonies now exist on hundreds of earth-like exoplanets across the Milky way Galaxy, making them one of the most widely distributed planet based life forms in the visible universe.
