This is an Oral history of my understanding of the Gamer Gate and Anti Gamer Gate movements. I say oral because I'm not going to cite my sources (many aren't archived) and just say shit as I remember it, being a digital native who hangs out in the places this shit started.

The term social justice warrior wasn't coined by Gamer Gate or 4chan, but it wasn't considered a badge of honor either until recently.

It was actually coined on communities like Tumblr to describe somebody who uses leftist rhetoric to justify petty indignation. Otherkin and furries comparing their "Struggle" to the gay rights movement, college freshmen who just read Marx and suddenly think they are ready to start a revolution,  etc... Some might say the SCUM manifesto would fall into this category, but that work is controversial.*
People who took things too far and shunned by other, more sensible, progressives and labeled as "Social Justice Warriors" as a chiding sarcastic remark.

This terminology eventually spread to 4chan who took equal pleasure in mocking them. Although outside it's original context, many started to believe that the SJWs represented a significant portion of Tumblr. What was once "Lets laugh at these people who are part of our movement and try not to let them take over" became "This is what we are up against, Look how crazy our enemies are!"

This was compounded as 4chan's ironic racism slowly morphed into sincere racism, and /pol/ slowly became a reactionary cesspit. The Social Justice Warrior went from marginalized Pariah mocked by both sides, to the Boogie man threatening to destroy western culture as part of some complex Jewish conspiracy. Social Justice warriors were EVERYWHERE, and it was up to the internet to fight back!

So of course the internet responded in the only way it knew how. Public Shaming and anonymous threats, with an occasional helping of ballot stuffing. Anybody who still thinks the internet will magically solve all our social problems at this point, is massively deluded. No matter what your cause is, that has been more or less the rule for internet activism.I don't think technology will make our lives better or worse, but it will accelerate things.  The internet is a great tool for quickly summoning an angry mob.

I'm not one to discount the benefits of violence, nor do I think a movement must remain peaceful to claim the banner of righteousness. I think that viewpoint is encouraged by the powers that be (who never seem to care if anybody thinks they are righteous) to make the people easier to handle. But that's another essay in itself. The important thing here is, Angry mobs are not an effective military formation. They rarely achieve the goals they set out to accomplish, and even when they do, they do so at great cost. If they have any value at all, it is only to deter further aggression in the future.

In this case, the angry mob had the exact opposite effect when internet reactionaries discovered Anita Sarkeesian. This feminist vlogger would have languished in relative obscurity. Virtually unknown outside her circles, she became a household name once she committed the serious crime of asking for money on kickstarter to make a video series making feminist critique of video games!

The threats started pouring in, and her kickstarter was funded with $158,922 over her modest $6,000 goal. If the kickstarter was a shameless cash grab, she definitely got more than she could have ever hoped for. And she couldn't have done it without her new "Fanbase." The constant rape threats also lent credibility to her arguments, after all if video games aren't sexist, why are people making sexist attacks against her?

Some might** accuse her of faking these threats to get free publicity, but it's never wise to attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. In this case, Stupidity can explain a lot. Even if Sarkeesian was some sort of Reptilian infiltrator, the proto-gamer gate crowd played directly into her hands.
