Growing up
----------
The girl who would become the last bride of heaven grew up on a remote T-1 planet that had not yet developed space-flight and was not yet eligible for union membership. Believed by her people to be the the earthly incarnation of a living goddess, she is selected at a young age and rules for a short period before retiring to private life and being replaced by the next incarnation. Although this position is prestigious, over the years, the Bride of Heaven has become largely a symbolic figurehead as the political power of the high priesthood increased.

Starting Out
------------
As the last Bride of Heaven was being selected, the Bug war was raging across the sector nearby. The Bugs were enslaving entire biospheres, and the Union was losing planets one by one. If the Bugs managed to get a foothold on this uncontacted planet, it would be completely defenceless.
